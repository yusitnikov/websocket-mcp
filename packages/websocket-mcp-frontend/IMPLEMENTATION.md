# WebSocket MCP Frontend - Implementation Details

## Architecture

The transport implements the MCP Transport interface using WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff. This creates a reliable bridge between browser-based MCP servers and the proxy server.

The key insight is that browser environments are inherently unreliable compared to server environments. Network connections drop, users navigate between pages, and browsers suspend tabs to save resources. The transport handles all of this complexity automatically, presenting a clean MCP Transport interface to the application code.

## Connection Management

The transport manages the entire connection lifecycle without requiring intervention from the application. When you call `start()`, it establishes a WebSocket connection with a configurable timeout. If the connection succeeds, it begins listening for messages and monitoring the connection state. If the connection drops unexpectedly, the transport automatically attempts to reconnect using exponential backoff.

The reconnection strategy starts with a short delay (1 second by default) and doubles the delay with each failed attempt, up to a maximum (3 seconds by default). This prevents the browser from overwhelming a struggling server while still providing responsive reconnection when the server comes back online.

## Resource Management

The transport uses `AbortController` to properly cancel connection attempts when needed. This is particularly important in browser environments where users might navigate away from a page or explicitly close connections. When `close()` is called, any pending connection attempts are immediately cancelled to prevent resource leaks.

## Browser Optimization

The design is specifically optimized for SharedWorker environments where a single persistent connection can efficiently serve multiple browser tabs. The transport maintains state about the connection and provides the `isConnected` property so applications can make informed decisions about their behavior based on connectivity status.
